Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

       
Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = id: 10000
ii. Hours = business_id: 1562
iii. Category = business_id: 2643
iv. Attribute = business_id: 1115
v. Review = id: 10000, business_id: 8090, user_id: 9581
vi. Checkin = business_id: 493
vii. Photo = id: 10000, photo: 6493
viii. Tip =  user_id: 537, business_id: 3979
ix. User =  id: 10000
x. Friend =  user_id: 11
xi. Elite_years =user_id: 2780


Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
	I picked Toronto and Food for this question. Yes. The restaurants with only 2.5 stars open from 8:00-22:00 on Saturday. The places with higher rating stars open late on Saturday.


ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
	Yes. The group with 2-3 stars has less review (10) compared with the group with higher rating stars.
         
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
	No, I wasn't able to infer anything since two groups had different locations.
SQL code used for analysis:
			SELECT
			business.name
			, business.city
			, category.category
			, business.stars
			,hours.hours,
			business.review_count,
			business.address,
			business.postal_code
			FROM (business INNER JOIN category ON business.id = 
			category.business_id) INNER JOIN hours ON hours.business_id =
			business.id
			WHERE business.city = 'Toronto' AND category.category = "Food"
			GROUP BY business.stars;

		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
		The ones that are still open have more reviews on average than ones that are closed
         
         
ii. Difference 2:
		There are more business that are still open listed as “useful” or “funny”.
         
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:

			SELECT
			AVG(b.stars),SUM(b.review_count),AVG(b.review_count),COUNT(r.useful)+COUNT(r.funny),is_open
			FROM business b INNER JOIN review r ON b.id = r.id
			GROUP BY b.is_open

	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
						Here I chose to study the preference among different types of food on dataset.

     
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
						I will pick several types of food including “Chinese”,”Mexican”,”Korean”,”French”,”Italian”,”Japanese” and “Indian”. Then I will analyze their star ratings and number of reviews so that I can get some inference on which type of food is
popular on the dataset. 
                           
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:

+----------+----------------------+---------------+-------------------+-----------+
| category | Number_Of_Resturants |    AVG(stars) | AVG(review_count) | city      |
+----------+----------------------+---------------+-------------------+-----------+
| Korean   |                    7 |           4.5 |               8.0 | Toronto   |
| French   |                   12 |           4.0 |     135.083333333 | Las Vegas |
| Chinese  |                   13 | 3.76923076923 |     423.230769231 | Las Vegas |
| Mexican  |                   28 |         3.625 |              73.0 | Edinburgh |

+----------+----------------------+---------------+-------------------+-----------+
         
         
iv. Provide the SQL code you used to create your final dataset:

								SELECT c.category,COUNT(b.name) AS Number_Of_Resturants,AVG(stars),AVG(review_count),b.city
								FROM (business b INNER JOIN hours h ON b.id = h.business_id)
								INNER JOIN category c ON c.business_id = b.id
								WHERE c.category IN ("Chinese","Mexican","French","Italian","Korean","Japanese","Indian")
								GROUP BY c.category
								ORDER BY AVG(stars) DESC
